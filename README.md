# 1. Sign Langauge Detection

  `Sign_Language.ipynb` is a jupter notebook created on colab to recognize sign langauage digits from 0 to 9 from pictures with hand signs. 

   We implement the CNN model using Keras.

   ## We have achieved 98.6% training accuracy.

The Data Set is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/ardamavi/sign-language-digits-dataset. Visit the site for more information regarding the data.
